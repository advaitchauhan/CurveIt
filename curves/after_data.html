<h1> Thank You! <h1>

<p> 
Thanks so much for sharing grades with us. Once again, they are totally anonymous, and are only added to the aggregate grade data for each class. Itâ€™s you and your contribution of data that lets us provide this service and help bring transparency to grading at Princeton! <br>

Now get exploring by typing a course name, department, or professor into the search bar!
